Multithreading is running tasks simultaneously. In the program i have used threading to run multiple loops , i have made a function to print the count in which i have used the sleep_for(1000ms) command to put the sleep time to 1s to calculate how many no of iteration the computer is able to run in that sleep time . In the main function i have declared a thread th to perform threading , the join command will wait until the thread th is done .
